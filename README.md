## About

This is a fun project [built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKy2lYEnhgs) with the [T3 stack](https://dev.to/nexxeln/t3-stack-and-my-most-popular-open-source-project-ever-5c31) (TypeScript, Tailwind, tRPC + Next.js and Prisma). The backend is a Planetscale MySQL database and the app is deployed on Vercel.

It's a voting and ranking app. It seeks to (democratically) answer the question: what is the softest pok√©mon? But the data source can be swapped out easily to make the project a general tool for ranking any class of objects on a particular attribute using 1v1 face offs.
